- Support for multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT models and Ollama models)
- Covers a wide range of USMLE categories including Anatomy, Behavioral Science, Biochemistry, and more
- Ability to focus on specific categories
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Conversation saving and loading functionality
- Token usage tracking

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- OpenAI Python library
- Ollama Python library
- python-dotenv (for environment variable management)
